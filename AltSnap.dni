; Please help with translations if you can.

Theme=
; Set desired icon theme. If set empty default icons are loaded.
; You can already try Theme=erasmion, You can make your own themes esealy
; You just need to create a floder in the Themes folder with 3 icons for
; the tray: TRAY_OFF.ico, TRAY_ON.ico TRAY_SUS.ico
; to load a theme specify the name of the floder.
; Note: a full AltSnap restart is required to update the theme!

AutoFocus=0

Aero=1
; Mimics Windows 7+ Aero Snap behavior.
; Drag windows to the left, right, top, or bottom side of the monitor.
; Corners work too! Hold Ctrl to trap the mouse cursor within the current
; monitor for easier snapping when using multiple monitors.

SmartAero=1
; If set to 1 (default), AltSnap will adjust the dimensions of
; a snapped window to other resized snapped windows.
; If set to 0, disabled, restores the old AltDrag behavior.
; If 2 is added, AltSnap will be smarter and snap to more windows.
; If 4 is added, AltSnapped windows will never be restored.

StickyResize=0
; If set to 1 or 3, other windows that are snapped to the current one
; can be resized by holding the Shift key.
; If set to 2, The above is done without the Shift key (Shift will disable it instead).

; If set to 0, disabled, does none of the above.

AeroHoffset=50
AeroVoffset=50
; Horizontal and vertical position (from top left in percent) where the aero
; windows will meet default is 50 50, at the center of the monitor.
; If you set AeroHoffset=33, for example, the windows snapped
; on the left will use only 33% of the monitor width, those on the right will
; have the remaining 67%. I strongly advise you to play around with this if
; you use Aero snapping...

InactiveScroll=0
; Adds the ability to scroll inactive windows. Hold shift to scroll horizontally.

CenterFraction=24
; A fraction in a percent from 0 to 100 that defines the size of the central
; resizing region (default is 24), used to be 33% in AltDrag beta.

SidesFraction=24
; A fraction in a percent from 0 to 100 that defines the size of the side
; resizing regions (default is 100) any value greater than CenterFraction
; will have the same effect than SidesFraction == CenterFraction.

MoveTrans=255
; Transparency from 1-254, which is set to the window that is currently
; moved/resized. Lower values are more transparent.
; If set to 0 or 255, the feature is disabled (default is 255).

[Performance]
;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;;
;; Formula for best perf:
;; 1) If you got a monitor to 60Hz set RezTimer=1 (or 2, should be default).
;; 2) If you got a high frequency monitor and a high freq mouse:
;;   a. Set RezTimer=3 or 4,
;;   b. Calculate the ratio Mouse frequency / Monitor frequency and take
;;      half that value as a starting point for MoveRate and ResizeRate.
;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;;
FullWin=2
; Set to 1 to force the Drag Full Windows option (old default)
; Set to 0 to force off
; Default is 2: autodetect based on Windows setting

TransWinOpacity=0
; Set opacity from 1-255 of the transparent window used when FullWin=0
; default is 0 which mean no transparency is used (best for performance).
; also 255 has good performance but there is zero opacity.
; If you are using desktop composition or Windows 8+ then there will be
; no significant performance impact to any value.

PinRate=32
; Rate in miliseconds from 1-255 at which the always on top indicator
; will be refreshed. Default is 32. Smaller values will make the
; indicator more reactive but will decrease the performances.

RezTimer=2
; Set to 1 to move the window only when the timestamp of
; a mouse event is different from the previous one, every 16ms
; more or less. MoveRate and ResizeRate and RefreshRate
; will have no effect if the option is enabled.
; This is overall the option that gives the best performances.
; It can be combined with FullWin=0 mode for ~0% CPU usage.
; Set to 2 for auto-mode, where RezTimer is only enabled if
; display frequency is set to 60Hz.
; Set to 3 to combine with the MoveRate and ResizeRate options
; Set to 4 for auto-mode bis (1 if 60Hz monitor and 3 otherwise).

RefreshRate=0
; Minimum delay, in milliseconds, between two refreshes of a window.
; For minimum CPU usage use a value around your monitor's rate:
; 75Hz monitor => RefreshRate=13
; Max value is 255 (4 Hz), sane values are below 100 (10 Hz).
; If set to 0 (default), you get the most reactivity.

MoveRate=2
ResizeRate=4
; The number of pixels to wait before actually moving the window.
; If set to 1, updates will be instant. You will have better perf with
; higher values but you will lose precision in moving/resizing.
; Sane values are below 10. Recommended is 1 to 5

[Zones]
UseZones=0
; If set to 1, enables Snap Layouts (Zones)
; If set to 3, enables Grid mode (configure below)
; If 4 is added window is extended without Ctrl.
; If 8 is added snapping will occur without Shift ie: 1+8 => UseZones=9.
; Shift will disable Zones instead.
; recomended is UseZones=1 or 9 for normal snap Layout with or w/o shift
; and 3+4 => UseZones=7 for grid mode.

ZSnapMode=1
; Zone snapping strategy
; Set to 0 to snap to the zones pointed by the cursor (default).
; Set to 1 to snap to the zone which center is the nearest from the cursor
; There is always the InterZone tolerance to snap to several zones.

InterZone=32
; Size in pixels between zones from -128 to +127 (default 32)
; where the window will be snapped to the union of zones.
; If set to 0, you cannot cover more than one zone.

ShowZonesPrevw=1
; Enable/Disables Layout preview (default 1)

ZonesPrevwOpacity=128
; Opacity from 0-255 of the Zone preview (default 160).
; Use 0 if you disabled Desktop composition.

ZonesPrevwBGCol=FF FF FF
ZonesPrevwBDCol=00 00 00
; Color of the Snap Layout preview, ZonesPrevwBGCol for background color
; and ZonesPrevwBDCol for the border color. default are white and black.
; Use a dark beckground and a light border if you use dark theme.

MaxLayouts=4
; Maximum number of layouts that you can switch btween
; Set to 0 or 1 if you want a single layout, 10 max.
LayoutNumber=0
; Currently selected layout (from 0 to MaxLayouts-1)

; If you set UseZones to 3 or 7 then you enabled the
; GRID MODE that simply cuts each screen into 'parts'.
; You can set the number of parts below:
GridNx=3
; Number of grid columns
